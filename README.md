# Laplace's equation app
This is a small interactive app for learning a few properties of Laplace's equation and visualizing its fundamental solution.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the app
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server (performance can be bad):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run the production build (good performance):
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
